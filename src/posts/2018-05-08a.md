Activists are bringing the demand for H&M to fulfil the living wage commitment to the annual meeting of H&M’s shareholders today. They will make sure shareholders are aware of the broad support for this demand. <!-- end -->
Over 75,000 people joined the campaign in just three days after we launched [this petition](https://act.wemove.eu/campaigns/760) together with wemove.eu.
